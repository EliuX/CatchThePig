## Synopsis

In 2013 I started learning how to develop Android applications. Then for testing my skills i decided to do this simple Android game, using none third party libraries, just what came with the Android SDK at the moment.

## Motivation

You will see a simple game alike to the Cat vs the mouse, so it will have some tunable Artificial Intelligence. It has sounds and images from "Angry Bird", so it looks like acceptable.

## Installation

I began the project using Eclipse but later i runned it in Android Studio with no issues.

## API Reference

Just Java and the Android SDK.
